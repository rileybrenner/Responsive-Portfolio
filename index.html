      <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Riley Brenner. I am a 26 year old software developer
          who is currently located in Berkeley, California. I am originally from a small beach town in New
          York outside of Queens called Long Beach. I currently work at Adobe as an Application Support
          Engineer. My undegrad studies were at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Wilmington
          is a port city on the southern coast of North Carolina. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in
          Business with a concentration in Marketing & Advertising. I currently work at Adobe in the Bay
          Area of California. Much of my free time is spent exploring outside. My passion in life is surfing. I started at an
          early age in elementary school in the temperate waters of Northeastern United States. Some of my
          other hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, paddle boarding, diving and fishing. My passions
          have taken me across the globe traveling to over a dozen different countries over the past few
          years. I sometimes find myself searching in some of the most desolate corners of the planet in
          search of the new frontier for waves and exploration.</p>
